### To-Do
- Create middleware so that from login it will redirect to welcome page if the user session is set.
- Create middleware so that from all other pages it will redirect to login if the user session is not set.
- Create sign-up page
### Dependency inclusion in the routes is a little messy.
- See where the authenticate controller includes models and settings.  How can I make this cleaner so I do not have to include these things in every file?

### I am still using plain-text passwords
- Please, no mocking allowed!
